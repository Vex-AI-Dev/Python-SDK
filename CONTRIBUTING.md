# Contributing to Vex Python SDK

We welcome contributions. Here's how to get started.

## Process

1. Open an issue first to discuss the change you'd like to make
2. Fork the repo and create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests before submitting: `pytest`
5. Open a pull request referencing the issue

## Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
- Use type hints from the `typing` module (we support Python 3.9+)
- Format with `black` and lint with `ruff`

## Tests

All new functionality should include tests. Run the full suite with:

```bash
pytest
```
